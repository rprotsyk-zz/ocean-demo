        Rosetta Miller
      </h4>
      <p class="text">Rosetta is a stay-at-home mom who married when she was 24, and now has 2 kids who are the center of her universe. Her husband has a dental practice, and they can afford to splash out on the latest fashions. Rosetta has a very busy schedule, and is rushing to her next commitment; sometimes, she can even be bossy and impatient with her friends! Although she seems to be outgoing, she is introverted sometimes and she hides it behind her compulsive actions. <br>
        As a busy mom on-the-go, Rosetta is concentrated on quality items with fast delivery. She doesnâ€™t have the time to do all of her shopping in stores, though she will window shop when the mood strikes her.
