      <p class="text">
        Rosetta married when she was 24 and now has a 2 kids who are center of her universe. Her husband runs a dental clinic, so their family can easily afford spending couple hundreds for clothing. This also a reason, why she sometimes treats her friends outwardly, and may be bossy sometimes. Although she seems to be outgoing, she is self-centered sometimes and she has to hide it behind her compulsive actions. <br>
        As a good housewife Rosetta is concentrated on the quality and prefers fast delivery, as she has no time to deal with all the shopping.
